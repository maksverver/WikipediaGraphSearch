The file is an array of little-endian unsigned 32-bit integers.
All sizes and indices are 32-bit values, which must be multiplied by 4 to obtain file offsets in bytes.
The file size is limited to 2**32 entries (16 GiB).
Vertex 0 is a reserved value which has no edges.

Header
  1 int: magic number 0x57494b49
  1 int: total file size
  1 int: number of vertices (V) including 0
  1 int: offset of forward edge index
  1 int: offset of backward edge index

Forward edge index
  V ints: offset of forward edge list (or 0 for empty)

Backward edge index
  V ints: offset of backward edge list (or 0 for empty)

Edge list:
  * ints: index of adjacent vertex (between 1 and V, exclusive)
  1 int: 0 (end of list marker)
